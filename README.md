## Objective  
The goal of this lab is to perform **Static Code Analysis** on a given Python program (`inventory_system.py`) to identify programming errors, bad practices, code smells, and potential security vulnerabilities using tools like **Pylint**, **Bandit**, and **Flake8**. **Everything is under static analysis branch not main branch .**

##  Tools Used  
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Pylint** | Checks for code quality, formatting issues, and potential logic errors |
| **Bandit** | Detects security vulnerabilities in Python code |
| **Flake8** | Enforces PEP8 coding style and formatting rules |
